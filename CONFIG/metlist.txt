# This file holds the meteorology related options that will be set when
# selecting a meteorology in autowrfchem_classlib.py.
#
# To add a new meteorology, you'll need to add a section delineated by
# "BEGIN ___" and "END ___" where ___ is replaced by the meterology name.
# Do not include quotes. List the options to set using 
#
# namelist:namelist_section:option = value 
#
# as an example,
#
# wrf:time_control:interval_seconds = 10800
#
# Only include one value per line (nested domains are not implemented).
# Whitespace does not matter.

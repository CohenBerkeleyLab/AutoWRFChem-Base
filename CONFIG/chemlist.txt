# This file holds the definitions for the various chemistry options that can be automatically defined in
# autowrfchem_classlib.py
#
# To add a new section, it must begin and end with the lines "BEGIN ___" and "END ___" (without the quotes) where ___
# is replaced with the name you want it to be called in the program. (e.g. BEGIN RADM2). This is case sensitive in that
# BEGIN and END must be capitalized. To mark the mechanism as a KPP mechanism, include the line @ISKPP anywhere between
# the BEGIN and END statements. 
#
# List each option to be set using "namelist:section:option_name = val" (without quotes). White space
# does not matter, but DO NOT include more than one value per line at the moment (nested domains are not implemented).

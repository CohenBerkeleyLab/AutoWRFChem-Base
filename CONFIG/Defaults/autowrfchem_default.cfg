[ENVIRONMENT]
# This section contains environmental variables that will be set before
# any step of AutoWRFChem is executed. These are normally needed during
# configuration and compilation of WRF and WPS to set paths to code
# libraries, determine which core of WRF to use, to activate additional
# modules in WRF, etc.
